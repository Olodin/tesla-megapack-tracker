# general

- [ ] add a proper footer in the base template



# integration of government data

- column to overwrite government data
- log when stuff is overwritten (ideally as json and human readable)
- can be shown on the website. (separate between user overwrites and governmnet data overwrites)
- based on the id, have distance to the coordinate for all projects that I cannot located
- for the second integration maybe have a class with some helper methods

- make a project class
  - ui rendering functions
  - history
  - government data etc
  - maybe can p


- think about how to be able to add a comment to certain changes
  - i guess having a yaml, automatically creating it and then being able to add a comment
  - however the triggering of the history script should only run whenever sth is committed, no?


- maybe add some accordions on the detail page to quickly show some info...
- if the overwrite is turned on, need to define the overwrite fields

- should automatically add a field since when the project is tracked. 


- add changelog blog and refer to it from the readme
- 

- better table on mobile...
