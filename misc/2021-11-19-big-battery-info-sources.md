# Big battery info sources

- wikipedia (but need to double check their sources also)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_storage_power_station
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_energy_storage_power_plants
- tesla news sites
  - https://www.tesmanian.com/
  - https://www.teslarati.com/
- battery / ev news sites:
  - https://www.energy-storage.news/
  - https://cleantechnica.com/
  - https://electrek.co/
- owners websites (they often list their portfolios)
  - https://www.lspower.com/map/
  - https://www.harmonyenergy.co.uk/projects/ 
  - https://recurrentenergy.com/project-portfolio/# 
  - https://www.pluspower.com/home#projects
  - https://broadreachpower.com/projects/
  - https://arevonenergy.com/portfolio/
  - https://www.res-group.com/en/portfolio/
  - https://octopusrenewables.com/investment-solutions/
  - https://www.hecateenergy.com/projects/
  - https://www.ngk-insulators.com/en/product/nas-solutions.html
- authorities websites (often the applications are public)
  - https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/home (this one is great as it even has a map search function)
  - https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_05 (this is a list of upcoming electric generating units including batteries, **this one is very good**)
  - https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=table_6_03 (list of installed generating units in the us)
  - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-energy-planning-database-monthly-extract UK renewable planning database
  - https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR Germany generation database
  - e.g. [goleta planning doc](https://www.cityofgoleta.org/city-hall/planning-and-environmental-review/ceqa-review/cortona-battery-storage-project)
- google 
  - search for the project name and add `approval` and e.g. the county name and often you will find the approval docs which are great to determine the exact location. 
- google maps
  - for old installations you will often be able to spot the installations on the satellite view and can then add precise GPS coordinates. 
- youtube
  - some installations will have drone flyover videos. From there it is also easy to determine exact location. 
- Global Energy Storage Database (GESDB)
  - https://www.sandia.gov/ess-ssl/global-energy-storage-database-home/
  - one big excel list, however was last updated only in 2020
- **Open Infra Map**
  - https://openinframap.org/#4.57/48.62/8.15
  - has quite a few battery projects integrated. Great to see the nearby substations / pv parks on there
- Global Solar power tracker
  - https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-solar-power-tracker/
- Twitter (general battery accounts)
  - https://twitter.com/AukeHoekstra
