- atm, ev manufacturers pay more for cells so the supply is a bit limited for ESS installations
- however the cell quality in the cars has to be higher
- in 2021 shareholder meeting Elon Musk said that the rest of the batteries they can get they will use for ESS projects
  - the packs should be spaced out far enough that if 1 catches fire, none of the other ones around are affected
  - unlike the Megapack fire in the Victorian Big Battery (VBB) project where the neighboring unit also caught fire
