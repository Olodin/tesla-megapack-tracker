# tesla-megapack-tracker

- Project tries to track all tesla megapack and powerpack (>5MWh) installations. 
- The site is hosted via github pages and this is the link https://lorenz-g.github.io/tesla-megapack-tracker/

# project structure

for now:
- all data is in the `project.csv` file
- the generated website is in the [docs](./docs) folder (it is called docs because of github pages)
- To generate the website, install the dependencies and run `python generate_website.py`
- To develop it is handy to use a tool like [watchexec](https://watchexec.github.io/downloads/) to listen to file changes and then rebuild the site. 
- to edit the CSV files, it is best to use Libre Office

eventually:
- every battery installation has a toml file located in the `battery-projects`
- in case there are multiple stages to a project, they will be in that file
- the naming of the toml file is `date_id_project-name`, e.g. `2020-01-01_4_first-megapack-project`

for the cars vs stationary:
- raw data is in the `cars-vs-stationary.csv` file
- using the vehicle production numbers (from the tesla quarterly press releases)
- estimating the avg model 3/y battery with 60kWh and the model s/x with 90kwh
  - in the future could also add a new column use a more precise estimate per quarter, but fine for now.
